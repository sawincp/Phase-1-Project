# My Phase 1 Project


## Project Objectives

- Create a working web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with data from the Rick and Morty open API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/api)
- The API data includes at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. 
- Interactions between the client and the API server are handled asynchronosuly and use JSON as the communication format. 
- The entire application runs on a single page with no redirects or reloads. 
- The application has 3 distinct even listeners(submit, click, mousover) that helps enable interactivity with the user. 
- The appliation uses at least one instance of array iterations (forEach) to manipulate the API data in some way. 
- Applicaiton follows good coding practices. 

### Project Proofs

1. API data includes at least 5 objects with at least 3 attributes:
(add picutre of API data)

2. Interactions are handled asynchronosuly and use JSON as communication format
(add code snippet)

3. Entire applicaiton runs on single page
(show breif gif of application at work)

4. Application has 3 distinct event listners
(show code snippet of event listeners)

5. Array iteration
(show code snippet)

### Conclusion
Based off of the project objectives and the corresponding proofs, the phase 1 project has been completed.
