## Description

The Rick and Morty search web app utilizes the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/?) to filter characters of the cartoon by name (full or partial), status (alive, dead or unkown), and gender (male, female, genderless). The user will then be able to click a button to show character's full information including what spicies they are, their last known location, their origin and total number of episodes that character has been in during the series.
